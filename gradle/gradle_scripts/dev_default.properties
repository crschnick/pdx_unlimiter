# Here you can define custom properties that should apply in your development environment
# when running the application. For example:
# com.crschnick.pdxu.myprop=myvalue

# Start up in fixed 16/9 window size, useful for demos and showcases
# You can change the window size in AppMainWindow
# com.crschnick.pdxu.showcase=true

# The local data directory, can be relative to the project dir or an absolute path
# com.crschnick.pdxu.dataDir=local

# When enabled, all changes to JavaFX nodes are monitored to ensure that
# they are made from the platform thread
# This will slow down the application significantly
# See the PlatformThreadWatcher class for the implementation
# com.crschnick.pdxu.debugPlatformThreadAccess=true
