## Downloads

If you have already installed the Pdx-Unlimiter, this update will be automatically installed when launching it the next time.
Otherwise you can download it from here:

### Installers

Installers are the easiest way to get started. Note that there might be some issues with Windows SmartScreen blocking the installer.
If you are facing these issues, click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".
You can read [this post](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/139520) if you want to understand
why this warning pops up.

- [Windows Installer](https://github.com/crschnick/pdxu_launcher/releases/download/{{version}}/pdxu_installer-windows.msi)
- [Linux .deb Installer](https://github.com/crschnick/pdxu_launcher/releases/download/{{version}}/pdxu_installer-linux.deb)
- [Linux .rpm Installer](https://github.com/crschnick/pdxu_launcher/releases/download/{{version}}/pdxu_installer-linux.rpm) (Experimental for now)

### Standalone

If you don't like installers, you can also use a standalone version, which is packaged in a .zip archive.
This version does not come with an update functionality, so you have to manually download new releases if you want to update.

- [Windows standalone](https://github.com/crschnick/pdx_unlimiter/releases/download/{{version}}/pdx_unlimiter-windows.zip)
- [Linux standalone](https://github.com/crschnick/pdx_unlimiter/releases/download/{{version}}/pdx_unlimiter-linux.zip)
