## Pdx-Unlimiter v3

The Pdx-Unlimiter got a complete rework in version 3. Essentially, on the technical side, it is a completely new application. On the game/save logic side, it stayed the same, meaning that all game integrations should exactly work as before.

### Upgrading

Right now, v3 is still in beta, meaning that it is not published as a full release yet. You can install it manually by downloading it from the GitHub page. The old Pdx-Unlimiter v2 will not offer the update yet automatically. 

Since the application is completely new, the Pdx-Unlimiter v3 is a **separate** application, meaning that you can install both the Pdx-Unlimiter v2 and v3 on the same system. The installations don't affect each other. You **don't** have to uninstall v2, you can keep on your system just fine. If you encounter some issue in v3, you can just switch back to using v2 without issue. The only thing you shouldn't do is run them both at the same time.

Once v3 is stable, the auto-updater will automatically offer the update and uninstall v2.

### New features

- A completely overhauled UI
- Support for light/dark mode
- Many more new appearance and applications behaviour settings
- Signed Windows releases, meaning no more SmartScreen popup
- An improved desktop icon

### Fixes

- Fix Ck2 install using the wrong directory on macOS
- Fix CLI on Windows not printing anything when run via the .exe

### Outlook

Please report any issues you encounter. There is a built-in issue reporter in the sidebar on the bottom. Alternatively, you can post your issue on GitHub or Discord.

### History

The Pdx-Unlimiter and its community has grown enormously over the last 5 years. From humble beginnings:

Thanks for being part of the journey so far, let's hope to another great 5 years! (And that Paradox doesn't screw up EU5)
