# Changes in 2.12.0

- Add support for Victoria 3.

- Implement a new save game info display system, which completely replaces the old one.
  It looks exactly as the old one, but makes it much easier to add more displayed save game information later on.

- Rework mod and DLC loading.
  This should fix issues with HOI4 DLCs and cosmetic DLCs not being enabled/disabled properly

- The coat of arms renderer for CK3 and Victoria 3 has been updated to come closer to the in game rendering results.
  Thanks to grotaclas for contributing here.
  It is also now fully functional compared to the pre releases which had some issues with it.
  
- The new coat of arms renderer can also put to good use either through its integration within the Pdx-Unlimiter editor
  or through the new CLI that allows you to render all coat of arms definitions for Victoria 3 or CK3 at once.

- This release also includes various bug fixes that accumulated over the last few weeks.
