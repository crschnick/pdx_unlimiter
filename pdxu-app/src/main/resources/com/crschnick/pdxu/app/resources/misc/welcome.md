## Pdx-Unlimiter v3

The Pdx-Unlimiter got a complete rework in version 3. On the technical side, it is a completely new desktop application. On the game/save logic side, it stayed the same, meaning that all game integrations should work as before.

### New features

- Support for EU5
- Fixes for CK3 1.18+
- Fixes for VIC3 1.10+
- A completely overhauled UI
- Support for light/dark mode
- Many more new appearance and applications behaviour settings
- Signed Windows releases, meaning no more SmartScreen popup
- An improved desktop icon
- Faster startup times and improved memory usage
- Support to run it in the system tray/background
- Better scaling for hdpi displays
- Fixes on Windows when pinning the executable to the taskbar
- Properly working file associations, without confusing various browsers thinking that pdxu can open zip files

### Feedback

Please report any issues you encounter. There is a built-in issue reporter in the sidebar on the bottom. Alternatively, you can post your issue on GitHub or Discord. Due to the large rework, there will probably a few unexpected issues at first. But those should be fixed quickly.

### Looking back

The Pdx-Unlimiter and its community has grown enormously over the last 5 years. From humble beginnings:
