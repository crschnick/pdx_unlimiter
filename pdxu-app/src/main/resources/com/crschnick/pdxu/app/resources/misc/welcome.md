## Pdx-Unlimiter v3

The Pdx-Unlimiter got a complete rework in version 3.0. On the technical side, it is a completely new desktop application. On the game/save logic side, it stayed the same, meaning that all game integrations should work as before.

### Upgrading

Right now, v3 is still in beta, meaning that it is not published as a full release yet. You can install it manually by downloading it from the GitHub page:

https://github.com/crschnick/pdx_unlimiter/releases

Since the application is completely new, the Pdx-Unlimiter v3 is a **separate** application, meaning that you can install both the Pdx-Unlimiter v2 and v3 on the same system. The installations don't affect each other. You **don't** have to uninstall v2, you can keep it on your system just fine. If you encounter some issue in v3, you can just switch back to using v2 without issue. The only thing you shouldn't do is run them both at the same time.

Once v3 is stable, the auto-updater will automatically offer the update and uninstall v2.

### New features

- A completely overhauled UI
- Support for light/dark mode
- Many more new appearance and applications behaviour settings
- Signed Windows releases, meaning no more SmartScreen popup
- An improved desktop icon
- Faster startup times and improved memory usage
- Support to run it in the system tray/background
- Better scaling for hdpi displays
- Proper launching and updating on Windows when pinning the executable to the taskbar
- Properly working file associations, without confusing various browsers thinking that pdxu can open zip files

### Feedback

Please report any issues you encounter. There is a built-in issue reporter in the sidebar on the bottom. Alternatively, you can post your issue on GitHub or Discord. Due to the large rework, there will probably a few unexpected issues at first. But those should be fixed quickly. Various known issues are planned to be fixed over the course of the beta.

You can also share ideas for improvements. The UI is not fully finished yet, so there's still some work to be done. If you have any ideas on how to improve it, feel free to share your ideas.

Thanks for being part of the journey so far, let's hope to another great 5 years! (And that Paradox doesn't screw up EU5)
