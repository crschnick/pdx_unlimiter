# Contributing

Any contribution is welcomed! There are no real formal contribution guidelines right now, they will maybe come later.

This project is based on [KickstartFX](https://kickstartfx.xpipe.io/), an advanced template for JavaFX applications. You can find all the instructions and documentation for the base application on the KickstartFX docs page. Unless the build workflows were significantly altered, the instructions from the documentation should apply.

To get started were setting up your build environment, incluing JDK and IDE, see https://kickstartfx.xpipe.io/setup.

To build and run the project, see https://kickstartfx.xpipe.io/build.

If you are looking to understand some of the concepts that guide KickstartFX and therefore also this application, check out the **Reference** pages on https://kickstartfx.xpipe.io.

To contribute translations, see the [translations directory](/lang) for details.
